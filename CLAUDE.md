### Regarding code development

For new implementations, please 
- Focus on delivering exactly what we discussed in the requirements - we'll add features incrementally
- Prioritize code readability over cleverness (clear variable names, straightforward logic)
- Keep it simple and maintainable rather than overly optimized

When you spot opportunities for additional features or improvements (which I appreciate!), please mention them in your updates rather than implementing them right away. This helps us stay on track with our current priorities.

The goal is code that works well and that any team member can easily understand and modify later.
